#2 

Based on the problm, and use substract and Conquer

T(n) = 3 * T(n -  n  / 2) + O(n^2)
where a = 3, b = n / 2, k = 2

Since a > 1, therefore 

T(n) = O(n^k a ^ (n/b)) = O(9n^2) = O(n^2)



#3

Based on the problm, and use divide and Conquer
T(n) = 4 * T(n / 4) + O(n)
where a = 4, b = 4, k = 1

The tool give the result:
T(n) = O(nlog(n))
